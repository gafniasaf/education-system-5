- Generate only explicitly requested code without extras or nice-to-have features
- Create comprehensive error handling for all operations and functions
- Avoid complex shell operations that can cause terminal hanging or blocking
- Use simple file operations with individual creation and verification steps
- Prevent multi-line shell commands that can fail or cause system issues
- Include validation checkpoints throughout all development workflows
- Implement immediate failure protocols for build or test failures
