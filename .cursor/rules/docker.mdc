- Use Docker exclusively for all development environments without exceptions
- Execute docker compose build after any file changes or modifications
- Run docker compose up for service validation after build completion
- Execute docker compose down for complete cleanup after task completion
- Avoid complex shell operations that can cause terminal hanging or freezing
- Use simple sequential file operations with individual creation and verification
- Validate container health before proceeding with development tasks
