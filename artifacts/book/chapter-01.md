Chapter 1: The Story - Two Apps, One Engine

Learning management systems are everywhere. Most cost a fortune and take months to set up. Plus, medical education needs different features from regular college courses - they need to track something called EPAs (basically, "can this student actually do the thing they're supposed to do?").

We built two apps that solve this problem:

Education Platform - Think of this as the basic version. Students take courses, complete lessons, submit assignments, and take quizzes. Teachers grade stuff and see who's falling behind. Pretty standard.

Experfolio - This is the fancy medical version. Instead of just "courses," we track EPAs (those skill checkpoints). Instead of just "teachers," we have supervisors who watch students perform real medical procedures and sign off on their competency.

Here's the cool part: both apps use the exact same engine under the hood. We didn't build two separate systems. We built one really good system and then put different labels on the buttons.

Why does this matter to you? Because if you understand how we built these, you can build your own version for whatever industry you're in. Dental school? Change the labels. Law school? Change the labels. Corporate training? Change the labels.

The engine stays the same. The words change.

So when nursing students log in, they see "EPA Progress" and "Supervisor Feedback." When regular college students log in, they see "Course Progress" and "Teacher Comments." Same screens, different words.

This book will teach you how that engine works, in plain English, so you can build your own version.
