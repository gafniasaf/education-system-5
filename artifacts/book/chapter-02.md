Chapter 2: Getting Started with Cursor - From Idea to Working Screen

Cursor is like having a really smart assistant who knows how to build websites.

You know how when you go to a restaurant, you don't need to know how to cook the food? You just tell the waiter "I want the chicken sandwich" and they bring you a chicken sandwich.

Cursor works the same way. You tell it "I want a screen that shows student progress" and it builds you a screen that shows student progress.

But here's the thing - just like at a restaurant, you need to be specific about what you want. You can't just say "I want food" and expect to get exactly what you're craving.

Here's how to talk to Cursor:

Step 1: What is this screen for?
"This is a dashboard for students to see their current courses and mark lessons as complete."

Step 2: What should it show?
• Course name
• How many lessons total
• How many lessons completed
• A big green button that says "Mark Complete" for unfinished lessons

Step 3: Who can see it?
• Only students can see their own progress
• Teachers have a different screen where they see all their students

Step 4: How fresh does the data need to be?
• When a student marks something complete, it should update right away
• It's okay if the total numbers take a minute to update

That's it. You give Cursor those four things, and it builds you a working screen.

What Cursor gives you back:
• A webpage at yoursite.com/dashboard
• All the behind-the-scenes code to save and load the data
• Basic tests to make sure the buttons actually work

The whole process takes about 10 minutes instead of 10 weeks.

The magic is in being specific about what you want. Don't say "a dashboard." Say "a dashboard that shows X, Y, and Z, where students can do A and B, and teachers can see C and D."

Real Example:
"I need a screen where students can see their assignment submissions. Show them which assignments they've completed, which ones are still due, and let them upload PDF attachments with their work."

We told Cursor exactly that. 15 minutes later, we were clicking around a working prototype.
