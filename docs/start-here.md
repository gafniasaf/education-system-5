### Start Here — Role-specific instructions

Say one of the following to the assistant and follow this guide:

- "you are coder A, scan the system for your tasks and proceed"
- "you are coder B, scan the system for your tasks and proceed"
- "you are coder C, scan the system for your tasks and proceed"

What happens next:
- The assistant will open the corresponding checklist under `docs/tasks/` and execute the steps in order, staying within the allowed file areas so workstreams don’t conflict.

Quick links:
- Coder A (Frontend/UI/UX): `docs/tasks/coder-A.md`
- Coder B (Backend/API/DB): `docs/tasks/coder-B.md`
- Coder C (QA/Automation): `docs/tasks/coder-C.md`

Parallel work rules are summarized in `docs/parallel-work.md`.
